# Welcome to vk.py üëã

> Extremely-fast, easy-to-use, ready for production. The asyncio based library for Python and Humans written to be efficient and reliable.



### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/Cl0ckHvH/vk.py-1.0.0a6)


## Install

Install package from PyPi: (current version is 6 alpha of 1.0.0)

## Usage

A simple example
```python
from vk import VK
from vk.utils.task_manager import TaskManager
from vk.utils.auth_manager import AuthManager
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")
auth = AuthManager("7999123456", "my-password")
vk = VK(access_token=auth.get_token())

async def status_get():
    resp = await vk.api_request("status.get")
    print(resp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    task_manager = TaskManager(vk.loop)
    task_manager.add_task(status_get)
    task_manager.run()

```

You can find more examples [here](./examples).

- Have a lot of tools (in bot framework) out-of-the-box for creating largest and powerful applications [click](./vk/bot_framework/addons):
    * Caching
    * Blueprints
    * Cooldowns
